# gotime

gotime is a command line application to track time and to simplify office work.
It's able to track time, to creat HTML and PDF reports and to create invoice drafts for a few web-based invoicing application

## Basic usage
A typical session looks like this:
```bash
gotime start acme
gotime stop
gotime report --month 0
```

## Documentation
Documentation about the command line is available at [docs/markdown](./docs/markdown/gotime.md)

## Data model

### Projects
gotime supports nested projects.
The simplest form is a project without any subprojects.

If you need to bill a single client for several distinct project then it's better to use subprojects.
For example:
```bash
gotime create project client1 client1/web client1/backend
gotime start client1/web
gotime stop
gotime report --split project -p client
```

This will create a report on all projects which belong to client1 with the tracked time per project.
